## Lab Setup

   - **Estimated Time**: 10 minutes

## Instructions

1. On the Finance and Operations page, in the top left, select the **Expand the navigation pane** hamburger menu.

1. Select the **Discount concurrency mode** menu, review the available options, and then select **Best price**.

    >[!NOTE] When choosing between the concurrency mode options, keep in mind:
    >
    >  - When multiple Compounded discounts are applicable, the highest discount will always calculate first.  The next highest discount is then calculated on the remaining amount.  This calculation hierarchy will continue until all applicable Compounded discounts have been applied.  
    >    **Correct**: 40% discount + 20% discount = 52% discount  
    >      - (40% discount on $100 = $40. Remaining = $60.  20% discount on $60 = 12. Remaining = $48)  
    >
    >    **Not Correct**: 40% discount + 20% discount = 60% discount
    >
    >  - Exclusive discounts will always apply over a Best price or Compounded discount, even if it is the lowest discount percentage.
    >    - When more than one Exclusive discount is applicable, the highest will be used.
    >  - When Best price and Compounded are both applicable or if multiple of the same one is applicable, the highest discount will be used.
